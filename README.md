# Folder-Locker
(Download the executable file)[https://github.com/cannizarro/Folder-Locker/raw/master/lock.exe].

This is my first project in C++ for that matter C (as I didn't used any OOP concept).
It uses various built in libraries and dos commands that cpp contain for manipulating the visual behaviour of windows explorer for showing or hiding elements.

It works simply by specifying the folder under certain classes present in windows by manipulating with CLSID present in Desktop.ini file which is present in every folder in windows.

The password you set is stored in password.txt. I know it's quite lame but I can work on that and figure someway to make it more discrete. But now at this point of time I am slightly bored of this project and thinking to move on.

To those who will actually read this README file ,I would like to thank you for taking interest in this project and your suggestions and corrections will be deeply valued if you are going to give any. Any bug fixes or code that will make password more discrete will be deeply welcomed.

I have just started coding and if you got some suggestions for better code structure or for that matter any general suggestions, you can shove it in your ass *joking*, you are welcomed to give it to me.

Thank You.
